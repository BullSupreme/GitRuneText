# RuneText Adventure Game

Welcome to RuneText, a text-based adventure and skilling game! Explore, gather resources, craft items, fight monsters, and level up your skills.

## Gameplay Overview

RuneText is an incremental game where you perform actions to gain experience (XP) in various skills, collect items, and improve your character.

**Core Mechanics:**

*   **Skills:** Level up skills like Woodcutting, Mining, Blacksmithing, Cooking, and Attack. Higher levels unlock new actions and better items.
*   **Combat:** Fight monsters to gain Attack XP and valuable loot.
*   **Crafting:**
    *   **Blacksmithing:** Smelt ores into bars, then smith bars into powerful 2H (Two-Handed) Swords.
    *   **Cooking:** Cook raw food to create healing items.
*   **Inventory & Equipment:** Manage your items and equip tools, weapons (2H Swords), and armor (Chestplates).
*   **Shop:** Buy basic tools and sell your hard-earned items for gold.
*   **Perk Tree:** Earn Perk Points by gaining total XP across all skills. Spend these points on powerful passive bonuses to enhance your gameplay.
*   **Auto-Actions:** Many skilling and combat actions can be set to "auto" mode, allowing for idle progress.

## Getting Started

1.  **Main Menu:** This is your central hub.
2.  **Actions:**
    *   Start by Woodcutting or Mining to gather basic resources.
    *   Once you have some resources, try Blacksmithing to smelt ores into bars.
    *   Attack weaker monsters like Chickens to gain Attack XP and some starting loot.
3.  **Inventory & Equipment:**
    *   Equip any tools you buy or craft.
    *   Crafted 2H Swords are your primary combat weapons.
    *   Chestplates (dropped by monsters) provide defense.
4.  **Shop:**
    *   Buy better Axes and Pickaxes to improve gathering speed and yield.
    *   Sell excess resources and items for Gold.
5.  **Perk Tree:** As you gain total XP, you'll earn Perk Points. Spend them wisely to boost your progress!

## How to Get 2H Swords (Weapons)

2H Swords are the primary combat weapons in RuneText and are **crafted through the Blacksmithing skill**. They are **not** bought from the shop or typically dropped by monsters (except for very rare specific monster drops, if any were re-added).

**Steps to Craft 2H Swords:**

1.  **Level up Mining:** Mine Copper Ore, Tin Ore, Iron Ore, Coal, etc.
2.  **Level up Blacksmithing (Smelting):**
    *   Go to `Actions -> Blacksmithing -> Smelt Bars`.
    *   Smelt your collected ores into metal bars (e.g., Bronze Bar, Iron Bar, Steel Bar). You'll need specific ores and Blacksmithing levels for each bar type.
    *   **Example:**
        *   `Bronze Bar`: Requires Copper Ore + Tin Ore (BS Lvl 1)
        *   `Iron Bar`: Requires Iron Ore (BS Lvl 15)
        *   `Steel Bar`: Requires Iron Ore + Coal (BS Lvl 30)
3.  **Level up Blacksmithing (Smithing):**
    *   Go to `Actions -> Blacksmithing -> Smith Weapons`.
    *   Use your crafted metal bars to smith 2H Swords. Each sword tier requires specific bars and a certain Blacksmithing level.
    *   **Example Recipes:**
        *   `Bronze 2H Sword`: Requires 5 Bronze Bars (BS Lvl 1 to smith, Attack Lvl 1 to wield)
        *   `Iron 2H Sword`: Requires 5 Iron Bars (BS Lvl 15 to smith, Attack Lvl 15 to wield)
        *   `Steel 2H Sword`: Requires 5 Steel Bars (BS Lvl 30 to smith, Attack Lvl 30 to wield)
        *   ...and so on for Mithril, Adamant, Rune, and Dragon tiers.

## Loot Tables (Notable Drops)

This is not an exhaustive list, but highlights key items and how to obtain specific gear. Many monsters also drop common resources (raw meat, etc.) and unique "junk" items for selling.

**Chestplates are primarily obtained as drops from monsters.**

| Wolf          | 10             | Raw Meat, Wolf Fang                                                                                          |
| Bear          | 20             | Raw Meat, Bear Claw, Cooked Meat, **Iron Chestplate**                                                          |
| Ogre          | 30             | Ogre Club Fragment, Cooked Meat, **Steel Chestplate**                                                          |
| Troll         | 40             | Troll Hide, Health Potion (s), **Mithril Chestplate**                                                          |
| Giant         | 55             | Giant's Toe, Cooked Meat, **Adamant Chestplate**                                                               |
| Demon         | 70             | Demon Heart, Health Potion (s), **Rune Chestplate**                                                            |
| Dark Dragon   | 85             | Dragon Gem, Health Potion (s), **Dragon Chestplate**, Special Dragon Ore (used for Dragon Bar/2H Sword)         |

**Drop Mechanics:**

*   Drop chances increase slightly based on your Attack level relative to the monster's level.
*   Specific unique equipment (like a particular tier of chestplate) will generally not drop if you already possess one (either equipped or in your inventory) to encourage progression through tiers.

## Tips for Success

*   **Balance Skilling:** Don't neglect any skill. Mining provides ores for Blacksmithing, Woodcutting provides logs (can be sold for gold), and Combat provides unique drops and Attack XP for better weapons/armor.
*   **Upgrade Tools & Weapons:** Always aim to use the best Axe, Pickaxe, and 2H Sword you can wield and craft/buy. This significantly speeds up progress.
*   **Use Food:** Cooked food is essential for healing during combat, especially against tougher monsters.
*   **Perks Matter:** Spend your Perk Points strategically. Early game, "Efficient Gatherer" or "Weapon Master" can be very beneficial.
*   **Save Often:** Use the "Save Game" button to download your progress. You can "Load Game" later using this file.
*   **Be Patient:** RuneText is an incremental game. Progress takes time!

Good luck on your adventure!
